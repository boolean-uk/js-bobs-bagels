Bob needs you!
He wants you to implement a simple basket feature for him.

# Part 1
```
As a member of the public
So I can order a bagel when I want to
I'd like to add an item to my basket

As a member of the public,
So that I can change my order
I'd like to remove an item from my basket
```

# Part 2
```
As a member of the public,
So that I can not overfill my small bagel basket
I'd like to know when my basket is full when I try adding an item beyond my basket capacity.
```
```
As a Bob's Bagels manager,
So that I can record more sales
Iâ€™d like to create baskets with larger capacity when I need to.
```
```
As a member of the public
So that I can maintain my sanity
I'd like to know if I try to remove an item that doesn't exist in my basket.
